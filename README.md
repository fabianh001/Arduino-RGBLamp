# Arduino-RBGLamp

This is a nice lamp I build for my desk. It features several modes, including rainbow, study, reading and disco mode.
Those modes can be changed by just pressing a button.
This project is based on a ESP (Node MCU v1) and a WS2812 ligth strip. 
Any other Arduino should be working in this project, too.
